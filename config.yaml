          I was a Software Developer from Oct 2016 until Jan 2017.
          I worked for 4 companies developing ASP.NET MVC applications that ranged from residential issue management, medical treatments, building and selling houses, to delivering packages.

          I was a Lead Developer from Jan 2017 until Feb 2020.
          During this time I lead a team of developers to maintain and develop new features for an existing ASP.Net MVC website.
          We built an angular electron tablet app for accessing safety documents, and completing vehicle checklists.

          I was a Senior Devops & Production Support Engineer from Feb 2020 until Dec 2021.
          I taught a team of graduates how to supporting and develop new features for both new and legacy production systems.
          We had around 15 production systems with 4 hour SLAâ€™s and 97% availability and uptime that covers over 1000 users per system.
          We covered a wide selection of technologies ranging from ASP.Net Web Forms, to ASP.Net Core.
          Nearing the end of my time at Audacia I made a major push to upgrade all systems from as low as Angular 2 and .Net Framework 4.5 to the lastest available platforms.

          Most of my time has been spent developing AngularJS applications to improve the user's experience, such as; 
          - the dashboard & dashboard widgets
          - map client which displays a live view of vehicles 
          - and a graphical user interface for the SSRS reports server.

          I also wrote a loadtester for our gateway server. The gateway server was the endpoint service that all vehicles on the road would contact.
          Writing the loadtester was particularly challenging due to the fact that no legacy documentation existed for the gateway protocol, this meant that I had to reverse engineer the protocol from old Delphi code.
          My favourite sub-project was spending a day learning F# and suave.io. Then using that knowledge to write a new secure gateway server with a web management API.

          From May 2016 I became an Aspire team member. I developed an XMPP chat client to be shared between two products Cortex & Aspire. This will be so that dispatchers are able to contact call responders from inside our applications without having to use a third party.
          At the time there wasn't a library available that implemented the MUC feature, so I implemented this for the open source project before handing development back to the maintainer.
