          I developed the map client which showed the live location of drivers, vehicle reports, and dashboard widgets.
          ...

          Artemis is an advanced resource management system to help improve driver behaviour, increase fuel efficiency & monitor resource utilisation. 

          During my time at here I have helped to redesign the ArtemisHub website to be mobile friendly. 
          Most of my time has been spent developing AngularJS applications to improve the user’s experience, such as; the dashboard, map client & a graphical interface for our reports server. I also wrote our map API & a loadtester for our gateway server. Writing the loadtester was particularly challenging due to the fact that no legacy documentation existed for the gateway protocol, this meant that I had to reverse engineer the protocol from legacy Delphi code. 

          My favourite sub-project was spending a day learning F# and suave.io. Then using that knowledge to write a new secure gateway server with a web management API. I managed to nearly fully complete the project. I'd managed to implement everything except TLS encryption, and then management moved me to a different team.

          As of May 2016 I am now an Aspire team member. Aspire is a contact management system for the police. I was rushed to this team because of sales reasons. At the moment I am writing an XMPP client to be shared between two products Cortex & Aspire. This will be so that dispatchers are able to contact call responders from inside our applications without having to use a third party.
